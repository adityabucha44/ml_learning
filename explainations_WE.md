# Word Embeddings in NLP


## word2vec

**Word2Vec** is a popular technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for learning distributed word representations, i.e., mapping words into continuous vector spaces where similar words have similar representations. Developed by Tomas Mikolov and his colleagues at Google in 2013, Word2Vec has been influential in advancing the field of word embeddings. 

### Key Concepts of Word2Vec:

1. **Word Embeddings**:
   Word2Vec represents each word as a vector of real numbers. These vectors are learned from a large corpus of text and capture semantic relationships between words. The primary goal is for semantically similar words to be closer together in this vector space.

2. **Skip-Gram Model**:
   In the Skip-Gram model, the objective is to predict the surrounding context words (the "context" is a fixed-size window of words around the target word) given a target word. For example, in the sentence *"The cat sat on the mat"*, if the target word is "sat", the context words might be "The", "cat", "on", "the", and "mat".

   - **Training process**: Given a target word, the Skip-Gram model tries to predict the words within a context window (say, 1 or 2 words before and after the target). The parameters of the model (the word vectors) are adjusted to maximize the probability of predicting the correct context words.
   
3. **Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) Model**:
   The CBOW model works oppositely. It tries to predict the target word from the context words (i.e., it takes the context words around a given word and tries to predict the center word).

   - **Example**: Given the context words "The", "cat", "on", "the", "mat", CBOW would predict the center word "sat".

### How Word2Vec Works:

- **Input and Output Vectors**: Word2Vec consists of two main layers: an input layer and an output layer. The input is a one-hot encoded vector representing the current word, and the output is the predicted probabilities for each word in the vocabulary.
  
- **Training the Model**: The model uses **stochastic gradient descent (SGD)** or **negative sampling** to adjust the weights (which represent the word embeddings) to minimize the error in prediction. Negative sampling helps make training more efficient by focusing only on a small subset of words at each step.

### Advantages of Word2Vec:

1. **Efficient Representation**: Word2Vec can learn meaningful representations of words from large amounts of text data, capturing rich semantic relationships such as "king - man + woman = queen".
   
2. **Capturing Word Relationships**: The vectors learned by Word2Vec can capture syntactic and semantic word relationships, including analogies, synonyms, and even some aspects of word composition (e.g., "big" + "house" → "mansion").

3. **Low-dimensionality**: Unlike one-hot encoding, which produces very sparse and high-dimensional vectors, Word2Vec produces dense, low-dimensional vectors, typically of size 100-300.

### Example:

If you trained Word2Vec on a large corpus, you might find that the vector for the word "king" minus "man" plus "woman" results in a vector close to the word "queen". 

### Limitations:

1. **Context Window Size**: Choosing the right context window size is crucial for the model. A smaller window size may capture syntactic relationships, while a larger window may capture more semantic relationships.

2. **Out-of-Vocabulary Words**: Words that were not in the training data will have no vector representation.

3. **Doesn't Handle Polysemy**: Words with multiple meanings (like "bank") might not have separate vectors for each sense, since Word2Vec generates one vector per word.

### Variants and Extensions:

- **GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)**: A related technique that combines the advantages of both Word2Vec and matrix factorization. Instead of using a shallow neural network, GloVe tries to model the global co-occurrence matrix of words in the corpus.
  
- **FastText**: An extension of Word2Vec developed by Facebook, which represents words as bags of character n-grams, improving the model's ability to handle rare words and out-of-vocabulary words.

### Use Cases:
- **Word Similarity**: Finding similar words or analogies.
- **Text Classification**: Using word embeddings as features in machine learning models.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Using word embeddings as part of a larger pipeline for identifying entities in text.

Word2Vec remains one of the foundational techniques in NLP, although more recent models like **BERT** and **GPT** (based on transformer architectures) have become popular for tasks that require more contextualized and deep semantic understanding.





## word2vec simulation

word2vec, let's say we have 2 sentences as our data, what happens, give me steps of how you think, word2vec is trained,

no need to explain what word2vec is, just simulate the training


Let's simulate Word2Vec training step by step, assuming we use the **Skip-gram** model for simplicity and two sentences as data:

### Sentences
1. "I love machine learning."
2. "Machine learning is amazing."

---

### Steps

1. **Preprocessing**
   - Tokenize the sentences into words.
     ```
     Tokens: ["I", "love", "machine", "learning", "machine", "learning", "is", "amazing"]
     ```
   - Remove punctuation and optionally lowercase.
     ```
     Cleaned Tokens: ["i", "love", "machine", "learning", "machine", "learning", "is", "amazing"]
     ```
   - Build a vocabulary with unique words.
     ```
     Vocabulary: ["i", "love", "machine", "learning", "is", "amazing"]
     ```

2. **One-Hot Encoding (Internally)**
   - Map each word to a one-hot vector representation.
     ```
     "i" → [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     "love" → [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     ...
     ```

3. **Sliding Window Context**
   - Define a context window size (e.g., 2 words).
   - Generate (center word, context word) pairs.
     ```
     Pairs:
     ("i", "love"), ("i", "machine"),
     ("love", "i"), ("love", "machine"), ("love", "learning"),
     ("machine", "i"), ("machine", "love"), ("machine", "learning"), ("machine", "is"),
     ...
     ```

4. **Initialize Word Vectors**
   - Initialize random embeddings for each word in the vocabulary.
     ```
     Embedding matrix:
     Word "i" → [0.25, -0.10, 0.35]
     Word "love" → [0.12, 0.45, -0.30]
     ...
     ```

5. **Training Loop**
   - For each (center word, context word) pair:
     1. **Forward Pass**
        - Compute the similarity between the center word's embedding and all other word embeddings.
        - Apply the softmax function to calculate probabilities.
     2. **Loss Calculation**
        - Compare the predicted probability distribution with the true one-hot encoding of the context word.
        - Compute the cross-entropy loss.
     3. **Backpropagation**
        - Adjust the embeddings of the center and context words to minimize the loss.
     4. **Update Parameters**
        - Use an optimization algorithm like SGD to update the embeddings.

6. **Repeat Until Convergence**
   - Iterate over all pairs multiple times (epochs) until the loss stabilizes.

---

### Output
- A trained embedding matrix where each word is represented as a dense vector in the embedding space.
- Example vectors:
  ```
  "i" → [0.18, -0.02, 0.25]
  "love" → [0.10, 0.40, -0.20]
  ```

This process yields semantic relationships, enabling tasks like similarity comparisons and vector arithmetic.



## How to determine Dimensions?

how do you deterine the dimentions of thevector and also, why one-hotencoding

Great questions! Here's how these decisions are made and why one-hot encoding plays a role:

---

### **1. Determining the Dimensions of the Word Vectors**

The dimensionality of word vectors (embedding size) is a hyperparameter you decide before training. Common practices are:

- **Empirical Choices**:
  - Typical dimensions range from **50 to 300**. For example:
    - Small datasets: 50–100 dimensions.
    - Large datasets: 200–300 dimensions.
  - Google’s Word2Vec pre-trained vectors used **300 dimensions**.

- **Factors to Consider**:
  - **Dataset Size**: 
    - Larger datasets can justify higher dimensions because they contain more data to learn meaningful relationships.
  - **Computational Resources**:
    - Higher dimensions require more memory and computational power for training and inference.
  - **Task Requirements**:
    - For tasks requiring nuanced relationships, higher dimensions (e.g., 300) might be better.
    - For smaller downstream tasks, lower dimensions (e.g., 50) might suffice.

- **Trial and Error**:
  - In practice, you might experiment with different dimensions and validate performance on a downstream task.

---

### **2. Why One-Hot Encoding?**

**One-hot encoding** isn’t the final representation but plays a crucial role in training. Here’s why:

#### **Reason for One-Hot Encoding**
- **Input Representation**:
  - In the Skip-gram or CBOW model, you need a numerical representation of words to perform matrix multiplications.
  - One-hot vectors are a simple and sparse way to represent a word's position in the vocabulary.

#### **What Happens to One-Hot Encoded Inputs?**
1. The one-hot vector is multiplied by the embedding matrix:
   - For a vocabulary of size `V` and embedding dimension `D`, the embedding matrix has shape `[V x D]`.
   - Multiplying a one-hot vector of size `[1 x V]` with this matrix results in the word's embedding vector `[1 x D]`.
   - Example:
     ```
     One-hot "love": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     Embedding matrix:
     [[0.25, -0.10],
      [0.12,  0.45],  <-- "love"
      [0.18, -0.15],
      ...]
     Result: [0.12, 0.45]
     ```

2. The one-hot encoding is never explicitly stored or used beyond this lookup. It's just a way to map words to their embeddings during training.

#### **Why Not Direct Word Indices?**
- Using word indices (e.g., "love" → 2) instead of one-hot encoding might seem simpler, but:
  - It risks confusion during training because indices don’t inherently map to meaningful features.
  - One-hot vectors clarify the positional role in vocabulary mapping to the embedding layer.

---

### **Conclusion**
- The **embedding dimension** is a hyperparameter influenced by your dataset size, task requirements, and computational budget.
- **One-hot encoding** is a simple, sparse, and effective way to map words to their initial embeddings during training. It enables learning meaningful dense vector representations through optimization.



## Shortcomings

what are the shortcoming, and what are the alternatives to word2vec, what's in teh trent nw


### **Shortcomings of Word2Vec**
While Word2Vec was a breakthrough in NLP, it has several limitations:

---

#### **1. Contextual Understanding**
- Word2Vec generates **static embeddings**, meaning a word has a single vector regardless of the context.
  - Example: "bank" has the same embedding whether it refers to a financial institution or the side of a river.
- This fails to capture polysemy (multiple meanings of a word).

---

#### **2. Lack of Subword Information**
- Word2Vec treats each word as an atomic unit, ignoring subword structures like prefixes, suffixes, or root words.
  - Example: "running" and "runner" are treated as separate words, losing shared semantic meaning.

---

#### **3. Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) Words**
- Word2Vec cannot handle words that are not in the training vocabulary, leading to **OOV issues**.
  - Example: New or rare words are unrepresented in the embedding space.

---

#### **4. Limited to Local Context**
- Skip-gram and CBOW rely on a fixed-size context window, limiting their ability to capture dependencies across longer text spans.

---

#### **5. No Hierarchical or Structured Relationships**
- Word2Vec embeddings are not inherently hierarchical and may fail to capture structured relationships (e.g., "dog" and "mammal" hierarchy).

---

### **Alternatives to Word2Vec**

Several advancements have addressed Word2Vec's shortcomings:

#### **1. GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)**
- **How It Works**: Trains embeddings using a word-word co-occurrence matrix across the entire corpus.
- **Advantages**:
  - Captures both local (context window) and global (co-occurrence) statistics.
  - Often performs better than Word2Vec on semantic similarity tasks.
- **Shortcomings**:
  - Still produces static embeddings.
  - Requires a precomputed co-occurrence matrix, which can be resource-intensive.

---

#### **2. FastText**
- **How It Works**: Enhances Word2Vec by breaking words into character n-grams and learning embeddings for these subwords.
- **Advantages**:
  - Addresses OOV issues by reconstructing word embeddings from subwords.
  - Captures morphological information, making it useful for morphologically rich languages.
- **Shortcomings**:
  - Still produces static embeddings.
  - Computationally heavier than Word2Vec.

---

#### **3. ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models)**
- **How It Works**: Generates **contextual embeddings** by using bidirectional LSTMs trained on large corpora.
- **Advantages**:
  - Captures context-specific meanings of words.
  - Represents words differently depending on the sentence context.
- **Shortcomings**:
  - Computationally expensive compared to Word2Vec and GloVe.

---

#### **4. Transformer-Based Models**
The trend in NLP is dominated by **transformer-based models**, which include:

##### **a. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**
- **How It Works**: Uses a transformer encoder to learn contextual word embeddings bidirectionally.
- **Advantages**:
  - Contextual embeddings handle polysemy effectively.
  - Pre-trained on massive corpora, providing strong performance out-of-the-box.
  - Fine-tunable for downstream tasks.
- **Shortcomings**:
  - Large memory and computational requirements.

##### **b. GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**
- **How It Works**: Uses transformer decoders for autoregressive text generation.
- **Advantages**:
  - Pre-trained for generative tasks.
  - Highly adaptable to tasks like text summarization, translation, and conversational AI.
- **Shortcomings**:
  - Limited contextual depth compared to bidirectional models like BERT.

##### **c. T5 and GPT Variants**
- Models like **T5**, **GPT-4**, and **LLaMA** push the boundaries of pre-trained transformers by excelling at specific and general NLP tasks.

---

#### **5. Current Trends**
- **Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Models like GPT-4, LLaMA, and Claude dominate for their ability to generalize across tasks.
- **Efficient Fine-Tuning**: Techniques like **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** and **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)** enable adapting LLMs for specific tasks without retraining the entire model.
- **Multimodal Models**: Combining text, images, and other modalities, as seen in models like CLIP and GPT-4 Vision.
- **Lightweight Models**:
  - Models like DistilBERT and TinyBERT focus on reducing size while maintaining performance, catering to edge devices.
- **Long-Context Models**:
  - Models like **GPT-4 Turbo** and **Anthropic Claude** excel at processing longer contexts efficiently.

---

### **Summary**
- Word2Vec is largely outdated due to its static embeddings and context insensitivity.
- **FastText**, **GloVe**, and **ELMo** improved embeddings incrementally.
- **Transformer-based models (BERT, GPT, T5, etc.)** are now the gold standard for NLP, with trends moving towards multimodal capabilities, efficient fine-tuning, and long-context understanding.


## word-word co-occurrence  meaning?

### **Word-Word Co-occurrence: Meaning**

Word-word co-occurrence refers to how often two words appear near each other within a given text or corpus. It is a measure of the association between words based on their proximity or co-appearance.

#### **Key Concepts**
1. **Window Size**:
   - A **context window** is defined around a target word (e.g., 2 words to the left and right of a word).
   - Words within this window are considered to co-occur with the target word.

2. **Count-Based Measure**:
   - A co-occurrence matrix records how many times each word appears alongside every other word within the specified context window.

#### **Example:**
**Sentence**: *"I love machine learning, and machine learning is amazing."*

- **Vocabulary**: `["i", "love", "machine", "learning", "and", "is", "amazing"]`

- **Context Window (size = 1)**:
  - For "I", the context is `["love"]`.
  - For "love", the context is `["I", "machine"]`.
  - For "machine", the context is `["love", "learning"]`.

- **Co-occurrence Counts**:
  - "I" appears with "love" once.
  - "Love" appears with "I" once and "machine" once.
  - "Machine" appears with "love" once and "learning" twice (from both mentions in the sentence).

#### **Co-occurrence Matrix**:
Each cell `(i, j)` in the matrix represents the count of times word `i` and word `j` appear together in the context window.

|           | I    | Love  | Machine | Learning | And | Is | Amazing |
|-----------|------|-------|---------|----------|-----|----|---------|
| **I**     | 0    | 1     | 0       | 0        | 0   | 0  | 0       |
| **Love**  | 1    | 0     | 1       | 0        | 0   | 0  | 0       |
| **Machine**| 0   | 1     | 0       | 2        | 0   | 0  | 0       |
| **Learning**| 0  | 0     | 2       | 0        | 1   | 1  | 0       |
| **And**   | 0    | 0     | 0       | 1        | 0   | 1  | 0       |
| **Is**    | 0    | 0     | 0       | 1        | 1   | 0  | 1       |
| **Amazing**| 0   | 0     | 0       | 0        | 0   | 1  | 0       |

---

### **Why is Word-Word Co-occurrence Important?**
1. **Captures Relationships**:
   - Words that co-occur frequently are likely to have related meanings or semantic associations.

2. **Basis for Statistical Models**:
   - Co-occurrence is the foundation for embeddings like GloVe, which derive word vectors by factorizing a co-occurrence matrix.

3. **Semantic Insights**:
   - Words like "machine" and "learning" have high co-occurrence, reflecting their semantic relationship.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - The raw co-occurrence matrix is large and sparse, so techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) reduce it to dense embeddings for practical use.

---

### **Limitations**
- **Context Size**: Small windows capture local relationships, but large windows dilute the importance of proximity.
- **Data Sparsity**: In large vocabularies, the matrix is mostly zeros, requiring dimensionality reduction.
- **Context Sensitivity**: Co-occurrence alone doesn’t capture nuanced meanings in varying contexts (e.g., "bank" in "financial institution" vs. "riverbank").

---

### **In Summary**
Word-word co-occurrence quantifies how often words appear together within a context, forming the backbone of early NLP techniques like co-occurrence matrices and GloVe. While powerful for static representations, modern models like transformers use attention mechanisms to capture richer contextual relationships.



## GLoVE

how does glove differ from word2vsc?

GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) and Word2Vec are both popular algorithms for generating word embeddings, but they differ fundamentally in how they model and learn word relationships. Here's a detailed comparison:

---

### **1. Fundamental Difference: Local vs. Global Context**
- **Word2Vec**:
  - Uses **local context** to learn word embeddings.
  - Models relationships by predicting a word given its neighbors (CBOW) or predicting neighbors given a word (Skip-gram).
  - Relies on **sliding context windows** to capture relationships.
  - Focuses on maximizing the likelihood of word-context pairs.

- **GloVe**:
  - Uses **global context** to learn word embeddings.
  - Models relationships by leveraging a **word-word co-occurrence matrix** across the entire corpus.
  - Embeddings are trained to encode statistical information about how often words co-occur in a large context.
  - Optimizes word relationships using ratios of co-occurrence probabilities.

---

### **2. Training Approach**
- **Word2Vec**:
  - Uses **predictive learning**:
    - Learns embeddings by predicting context words (Skip-gram) or target words (CBOW).
    - Optimized using methods like **negative sampling** or **hierarchical softmax** to make training efficient.
  - Stochastic training: Processes one context window at a time.

- **GloVe**:
  - Uses **count-based learning**:
    - Embeddings are derived by factorizing the co-occurrence matrix.
    - The objective function minimizes the difference between the dot product of word vectors and the logarithm of their co-occurrence counts.
  - Deterministic training: Relies on global corpus-wide statistics.

## what's global here?
Models relationships by leveraging a word-word co-occurrence matrix across the entire corpus.

what do you mean accros the entire corpus


When we say **"across the entire corpus"** in the context of GloVe, we mean that the **word-word co-occurrence matrix** is built using statistics derived from the entirety of the text data (corpus) rather than from small, localized contexts (as in Word2Vec). Let me break this down:

---

### **Word-Word Co-occurrence Across the Entire Corpus**

1. **Global Corpus Context**:
   - The GloVe model scans the entire corpus (all the sentences, paragraphs, or documents) to record how often pairs of words appear together.
   - Unlike Word2Vec, which focuses on small windows of context around each word, GloVe builds a matrix that reflects all co-occurrences observed in the corpus, irrespective of where they occur.

2. **Example**:
   - Consider this corpus:
     ```
     "I love machine learning."
     "Machine learning is amazing."
     ```
   - GloVe counts how often every word pairs with every other word, across both sentences.
   - It doesn't restrict itself to a context window of nearby words.

   The co-occurrence counts might look like this:

   | Word         | I   | Love | Machine | Learning | Is  | Amazing |
   |--------------|-----|------|---------|----------|-----|---------|
   | **I**        | 0   | 1    | 0       | 0        | 0   | 0       |
   | **Love**     | 1   | 0    | 1       | 0        | 0   | 0       |
   | **Machine**  | 0   | 1    | 0       | 2        | 1   | 1       |
   | **Learning** | 0   | 0    | 2       | 0        | 1   | 1       |
   | **Is**       | 0   | 0    | 1       | 1        | 0   | 1       |
   | **Amazing**  | 0   | 0    | 1       | 1        | 1   | 0       |

   - These counts represent co-occurrence statistics **for the whole corpus**.

---

### **Why Is This Important?**
- **Global Relationships**:
  - By using the full co-occurrence matrix, GloVe captures global relationships between words.
  - Example: Words like "king" and "queen" might not co-occur in a single context window, but their co-occurrence with shared words like "crown" or "royal" across the entire corpus establishes their similarity.

- **Contrast with Word2Vec**:
  - Word2Vec relies only on local context windows (e.g., words within 5 positions). It doesn’t aggregate statistics for pairs of words that might be related globally but don’t appear near each other frequently.

---

### **Summary**
When we say GloVe uses "co-occurrence across the entire corpus," we mean:
1. It processes the **entire dataset** to compute the co-occurrence statistics of every pair of words.
2. These statistics reflect the overall structure of the language in the corpus, not just local snippets.
3. This enables GloVe to build embeddings that capture both **semantic similarity** and **global relationships**, which Word2Vec might miss.


## What else in the space?

how about others fast one and then foucs to transformers



### **Alternatives to Word2Vec (Pre-Transformer Era)**

Before transformers revolutionized NLP, several advancements improved upon Word2Vec's limitations. Here's a quick rundown of notable models leading up to transformers:

---

- **Drawbacks**:
  - Still generates static embeddings (single vector per word).

---

### **3. ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models)**
- **Key Idea**: Uses a **bi-directional LSTM** trained on a language modeling objective.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Contextual embeddings**: Word representations depend on their context in a sentence.
  - Captures polysemy (e.g., "bank" in financial vs. river contexts).
- **Drawbacks**:
  - Computationally expensive.
  - Sequential processing of text (not parallelizable like transformers).

---

### **4. ULMFiT (Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification)**
- **Key Idea**: Fine-tunes a pre-trained LSTM language model for specific tasks.
- **Advantages**:
  - Adaptable to downstream tasks with minimal data.
  - Strong performance in transfer learning.
- **Drawbacks**:
  - Sequential processing, slower training and inference compared to transformers.

---

### **Enter the Transformers**

With the advent of transformers, NLP saw a paradigm shift from static and context-limited embeddings to dynamic, deeply contextualized models.

---

### **5. Transformers (Attention Is All You Need)**
- **Key Idea**: Leverages the **self-attention mechanism** to model relationships between all words in a sequence, regardless of distance.
- **Advantages**:
  - Parallelizable: Processes the entire input at once (unlike LSTMs).
  - Captures long-range dependencies.
  - Forms the backbone of modern NLP architectures like BERT and GPT.

---

### **6. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**
- **Key Idea**: Pre-trained using a masked language model objective.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Bidirectional context**: Considers both left and right contexts.
  - Strong performance on understanding tasks (e.g., question answering).
- **Drawbacks**:
  - Inefficient for text generation (decoder-only models like GPT are better).

---

### **7. GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**
- **Key Idea**: Pre-trained using a causal language model objective (predicting the next token).
- **Advantages**:
  - Effective for text generation.
  - Pre-training on large corpora allows fine-tuning for downstream tasks.
- **Drawbacks**:
  - Struggles with bidirectional context (fixed in newer iterations like GPT-4).

---

### **8. Modern Trends: Transformer Variants**
- **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)**:
  - Frames all NLP tasks as text-to-text problems.
- **DistilBERT**:
  - Lighter, faster version of BERT.
- **LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, PaLM)**:
  - Massive models leveraging billions of parameters for general-purpose tasks.

---

### **Why Transformers Dominate Now**
- **Scalability**: Efficient parallel processing with attention mechanisms.
- **Versatility**: Handles tasks from classification to generation seamlessly.
- **Pre-training + Fine-tuning Paradigm**: Universal architecture for many tasks.

In short, **Word2Vec → GloVe → FastText → ELMo → Transformers (BERT, GPT)** represents the evolution of NLP models, with transformers now at the forefront due to their flexibility, power, and state-of-the-art performance.



## out of vocab words??

Advantages:

    Handles out-of-vocabulary words by breaking them into subword units.
    Captures morphology of words, useful for morphologically rich languages.

Drawbacks:

    Still generates static embeddings (single vector per word).

explain in more depth


FastText's ability to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and capture word morphology stems from its innovative use of **subword units**, but its static embeddings remain a limitation. Here’s a more in-depth explanation:

---

### **Advantages**

#### 1. **Handles Out-of-Vocabulary Words**
   - **Problem with Word2Vec and GloVe**:
     - These models assign a single embedding vector to each word in the vocabulary.
     - Words not present in the training data (OOV words) will lack embeddings, making them unusable in downstream tasks.
   - **How FastText Solves This**:
     - FastText represents words as a collection of **character-level n-grams**.
     - For example, the word **"running"** might be broken into n-grams like:
       ```
       "run", "unn", "nni", "ing"
       ```
     - The word's embedding is then computed as the sum (or average) of the embeddings of its constituent n-grams.
     - If a word is OOV, FastText can still generate an embedding by using the embeddings of its n-grams, provided these subwords appeared during training.
   - **Benefit**:
     - This approach allows FastText to generalize better and assign embeddings to rare or unseen words, particularly in cases like **misspelled words** or **morphological variants**.

#### 2. **Captures Morphology of Words**
   - **What Is Morphology?**
     - Morphology refers to the structure of words, including prefixes, suffixes, and root forms. For example:
       - Root: **"run"**
       - Inflections: **"running", "runner", "ran"**
   - **Why Morphology Matters**:
     - Many languages (e.g., Finnish, Turkish, Arabic) have complex word structures with extensive inflections and derivations.
     - Capturing the shared roots or patterns among these variations is crucial for understanding semantic and syntactic relationships.
   - **How FastText Captures Morphology**:
     - By decomposing words into n-grams, FastText effectively learns embeddings that reflect shared subword features. For instance:
       - The embeddings for "running," "runner," and "ran" will share components because they include overlapping n-grams like "run".
   - **Benefit**:
     - FastText works well for morphologically rich languages where traditional word-based models struggle due to a vast number of inflected forms.

### **Drawbacks**

#### 1. **Static Embeddings**
   - **What Are Static Embeddings?**
     - A static embedding assigns a single, fixed vector to a word regardless of its context in a sentence.
     - Example:
       - The word **"bank"** will have the same embedding in:
         1. "She went to the **bank** to deposit money."
         2. "The boat is near the river **bank**."
   - **Why This Is a Limitation**:
     - Many words are polysemous, meaning their meaning depends on the context.
     - Static embeddings like those produced by Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText cannot differentiate between different senses of a word.
   - **Impact on FastText**:
     - Despite its ability to handle OOV words and capture morphology, FastText still assigns a single vector to a word (or its n-gram aggregate), making it unable to adjust for different contexts.
   - **Comparison to Contextual Embeddings**:
     - Modern models like ELMo, BERT, and GPT generate **contextual embeddings**, where the representation of a word depends on its surrounding words, allowing them to capture nuances in meaning.

---

### **Example: FastText in Action**
Consider the sentence:  
- "The **baker** was **baking** a **cake**."

FastText will:
- Represent "baker," "baking," and "cake" as a combination of their n-grams (e.g., "bak," "ake").
- Leverage shared subwords like "bak" to produce embeddings that reflect their morphological similarity.
- But the embedding for "cake" will remain static, unable to account for its contextual use in, say, "Let them eat cake!" (a metaphorical statement).

---

### **Conclusion**
FastText’s subword-level modeling addresses critical issues like OOV words and morphological richness, making it particularly valuable for non-English languages and noisy datasets. However, its **static embeddings** limit its ability to handle polysemy and nuanced meanings, which are better addressed by modern **contextual models like BERT or GPT.**


## Bases of split??


In FastText, splitting words into **subword units** (n-grams) is based on character sequences of a predefined length. The splitting process aims to capture the morphological structure of words, allowing for robust handling of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and morphologically rich languages.

Here’s how the splitting process works and the factors involved:

---

### **1. Basis for Splitting: Character N-Grams**
- An **n-gram** is a contiguous sequence of `n` characters extracted from a word.
- For example, given the word **"running"** and a chosen range of `n` (say 3 to 5), the n-grams are:
  - **3-grams**: "run", "unn", "nni", "nin", "ing"
  - **4-grams**: "runn", "unni", "nnin", "ning"
  - **5-grams**: "runni", "unnin", "nning"

---

### **2. Key Decisions in Splitting**

#### a. **Length of N-Grams**
- The length of the n-grams (e.g., 3, 4, 5 characters) is a hyperparameter set before training.
- **Typical Defaults**:
  - Most implementations use n-grams in the range of 3 to 6 characters.
- **Reasoning**:
  - Short n-grams (like 3-grams) capture prefixes, suffixes, and common roots.
  - Longer n-grams capture larger morphological patterns or entire small words.

---

#### b. **Word Boundaries**
- FastText usually adds **special boundary markers** to words (e.g., `<` and `>`), treating the word as a unit.
- For example:
  - Word: **"cat"**
  - After boundary markers: `<cat>`
  - Extracted 3-grams: `<ca`, `cat`, `at>`

This ensures n-grams capture word prefixes and suffixes distinctly.

---

#### c. **Coverage of Entire Word**
- FastText doesn’t rely on only one length of n-gram but uses all possible n-grams within the specified range.
- For example, if the range is 3 to 5, for **"running"**, it computes embeddings for all:
  - 3-grams: "run", "unn", "nni", "nin", "ing"
  - 4-grams: "runn", "unni", "nnin", "ning"
  - 5-grams: "runni", "unnin", "nning"

The word’s final embedding is the sum (or average) of these n-gram embeddings.

---

#### d. **Handling Special Cases**
- **Rare Words**:
  - For words not in the vocabulary, FastText relies entirely on their subword n-grams.
- **Short Words**:
  - Words shorter than the minimum n-gram length (e.g., "a" or "is") are treated as single tokens with boundary markers.

---

### **3. Why Splitting Works**
- **Morphological Awareness**:
  - By splitting into character n-grams, FastText can identify shared patterns across morphologically similar words. For example:
    - "run", "running", "runner" → All contain the n-gram "run".
  - This makes embeddings of related words similar.
- **OOV Handling**:
  - Even if "unrunning" is OOV, FastText can still approximate its meaning using known n-grams like "run", "unn", and "ing".

---

### **4. Hyperparameter Considerations**
- **Range of N**:
  - Larger ranges capture more structure but increase computation.
  - Common: 3 to 6 characters.
- **Embedding Aggregation**:
  - The final word embedding is computed by summing or averaging the embeddings of all its n-grams.

---

### **Example: Splitting the Word "unbelievable"**
- Word: **unbelievable**
- With a 3-gram to 5-gram range, boundary markers: `<unbelievable>`
- Extracted n-grams:
  - **3-grams**: `<un`, `unb`, `nbe`, `bel`, ..., `ble>`
  - **4-grams**: `<unb`, `unbe`, `nbel`, ..., `able>`
  - **5-grams**: `<unbe`, `unbel`, `nbeli`, ..., `vable>`

Each of these subwords contributes to the final embedding, capturing shared patterns with other morphologically similar words.

---

### **Conclusion**
The splitting in FastText is based on character-level **n-grams** within a predefined range and is driven by the need to:
1. Capture morphological features like prefixes, suffixes, and roots.
2. Generalize to unseen words by approximating their meanings from subword units.
This subword-centric approach sets FastText apart from Word2Vec and GloVe while retaining simplicity and efficiency.


## what else???
 in between fasttext and transformers?

If we look at the evolution of NLP models, **FastText** and **transformers** represent two distinct stages. While FastText focuses on static word representations and subword units, transformers introduce a dynamic, context-aware approach that has dramatically advanced the field of NLP. Here's a breakdown of the key differences, transitions, and concepts in between FastText and transformers:

### **1. Limitations of FastText**
- **Static Embeddings**: FastText, like Word2Vec and GloVe, generates embeddings that remain fixed for each word (or subword) regardless of context. This means that homonyms or polysemous words are represented the same way in different contexts.
- **Limited Contextual Understanding**: Although FastText captures subword information and can handle OOV words by generating embeddings from subword n-grams, it does not understand the relationships between words in a sentence or adapt to word order.

### **2. The Shift to Contextual Embeddings**
- **ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models)**: ELMo introduced **contextualized word embeddings**. Unlike static embeddings, ELMo generates embeddings that change depending on the word's context in a sentence. It does this using a **bi-directional LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) network that reads text from left-to-right and right-to-left, capturing context.
  - **Example**: In the sentences "I read a book" and "I will read tomorrow," the word "read" would have different embeddings based on its context.
- **Drawbacks of LSTM-based Models**: Although ELMo improved upon FastText by adding context, it still had limitations in handling long-range dependencies and complex relationships due to the sequential nature of LSTMs.

### **3. The Advent of Transformers**
- **Transformers Introduced**: The transformer architecture, introduced by Vaswani et al. in "Attention is All You Need" (2017), moved away from the sequential processing of RNNs and LSTMs and instead used a **self-attention mechanism** to model relationships between all words in a sentence simultaneously.
- **Advantages of Transformers**:
  - **Parallelization**: Unlike RNNs, transformers do not need to process words in order, allowing for faster training.
  - **Better Contextual Representation**: Transformers can capture complex dependencies and relationships between words over long distances, which is essential for understanding context.
- **Self-Attention Mechanism**:
  - The core innovation of transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which enables each word in a sentence to "attend" to every other word, weighted by their relevance to each other. This produces context-aware embeddings for each word.
  - **Example**: In the sentence "The bank of the river," the word "bank" would be able to attend to the word "river" to better understand its meaning.

### **4. Key Differences Between FastText and Transformers**
- **Context**: FastText creates static word or subword embeddings that do not change depending on the sentence context. Transformers, on the other hand, create embeddings that are highly context-dependent.
- **Architecture**: FastText relies on simple word-level or subword-level embeddings and does not incorporate any mechanism for attending to other words in the sentence. Transformers use the self-attention mechanism, allowing words to interact with and influence each other’s embeddings in real-time.
- **Training Method**: FastText uses a simple CBOW or skip-gram approach with subwords to train word embeddings, while transformers train on a language modeling task or tasks like masked language modeling (BERT) or autoregressive generation (GPT).

### **5. Example Models: Transition from FastText to Transformers**
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: BERT uses a transformer encoder to generate context-aware embeddings. It is trained using a **masked language modeling** task where some words in the input are masked, and the model learns to predict them based on the context.
- **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**: GPT uses a transformer decoder architecture and is trained using a **causal language modeling** task, predicting the next word in a sequence, enabling it to generate coherent text.

### **6. Hybrid Approaches**
- **Combining FastText with Transformers**: Some models use the strengths of both approaches by incorporating static word embeddings (like FastText) as initial input features to transformers, enhancing performance in certain NLP tasks.
- **Subword-Level Models**: Transformers like **BERT and GPT** can still benefit from subword tokenization, such as **WordPiece** (used in BERT) or **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** (used in GPT). This approach allows them to handle OOV words by breaking them into known subword units, similar to FastText’s approach.

### **7. Advantages of Moving from FastText to Transformers**
- **Contextualization**: Transformers produce embeddings that vary based on the context of the word, which is essential for understanding polysemy and complex sentences.
- **Long-Range Dependencies**: The self-attention mechanism in transformers allows them to capture relationships between words even if they are far apart in the text.
- **Versatility**: Transformer-based models can be fine-tuned for a wide range of tasks, including text generation, translation, summarization, and question-answering.

### **Conclusion**
The move from **FastText** to **transformers** represents a leap from simple, context-independent word representations to sophisticated, context-aware models capable of understanding complex relationships. Transformers have set the stage for state-of-the-art NLP models that are now widely used across the industry for a variety of applications.
